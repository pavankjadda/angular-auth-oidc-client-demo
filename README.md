# Angular base project created in v16

This project acts as base project for all v16 Angular projects. It contains all the necessary dependencies and
configurations to start a new project.

1. Esbuild (vite)
2. Standalone components
3. Signals
4. Prettier
5. Eslint
6. Jest (unit testing)
7. Playwright (e2e testing)

By default, new component or directive generates standalone version with inline template and styles. And tests are skipped.
## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you
change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
